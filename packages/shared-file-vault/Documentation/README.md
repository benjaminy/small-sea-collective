# Small Sea Shared File Vault

Decentralized file sharing!

File Vault works similarly to conventional cloud file sharing (Dropbox, Nextcloud File, etc).
But it's a Small Sea app, which means that there is no File Vault service running on the internet somewhere for all File Vault users.
Rather every file vault niche (a shared folder) belongs to some Small Sea Team, and changes made locally are published to teammates according to each user's own services and Small Sea setup.
